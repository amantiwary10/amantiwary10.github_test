  abstract = {This paper discusses the design of a Formula SAE racecar chassis
              for torsional stiffness. At first, the need of having a torsionally
              stiff chassis is discussed. Then an attempt is made to answer the 
              question- how stiff is stiff enough? To answer this question, a 
              mathematical model of a flexiblevchassis is developed and compared
              to an infinitely stiff chassis based on roll stiffness distribution
              and lateral load transfer distribution. Two methods are developed 
              to reach the target torsional stiffness value with minimum weight
              possible, one, by changing the cross sectional area of the tubes 
              and second, by reallocation of tubes. In the end specific 
              structural members are predicted which have a high effect on 
              torsional stiffness of chassis.},
