Hello, and welcome! I appreciate you taking the time to explore my website. I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I specialized in motion planning, controls, and, computer vision. I served as a Research Assistant in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://uwacl.com/), under the guidance of [Prof. Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://uwacl.com/behet-akmee). My research focused on integrating active vision techniques with guarantees of convex optimization-based guidance methods for model-based navigation. I developed a guidance framework that generated feasible trajectories to capture high resolution images of a structure and create a digital twin. 

Building on this foundation, my broader research interests lies in developing efficient, real-time numerical algorithms for real-world applications. I am deeply intrigued by the potential of active vision techniques to enhance robust autonomous navigation, making intelligent systems more adaptable in dynamic environments.

Before my academic journey at the University of Washington, I worked as a Senior Manger at [Tata Motors Ltd](https://www.tatamotors.com/)., where I was a part of the Cost Engineering Team. I tasked with generating cost avoidance opportunities for gearbox and engine cooling systems, all while maintaining the vehicle's performance.

Feel free to explore the projects section to see some of my work. If you’d like to chat or collaborate, I’d love to hear from you! You can reach me via email.
