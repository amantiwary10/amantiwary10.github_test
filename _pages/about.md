I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I specialize in Controls, Trajectory Optmization, and, Computer Vision. I serve as a Research Assistant at the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://uwacl.com/) under the guidance of [Prof. Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://uwacl.com/behet-akmee). My passion lies in developing efficient, innovative systems for real-world applications. I am deeply intrigued by leveraging active vision techniques to enhance robust autonomous robot navigation.
